# Web Visualization Dashboard

## Background

Use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off weather analysis.


## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I will be creating a visualization dashboard website using weather visualizations. Specifically, I will be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I will create individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There will also be a landing page, a page where you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
